NOTE: once you finish a challenge, we recommend commenting out the code from that challenge before starting the next one; otherwise, repl.it will draw all shapes over each other, and it will be messy. To accomplish this, highlight that code from that challenge and then press ctrl + /, or if you're on a mac, then cmd + /. Alternatively, you can comment out the lines one by one by placing a # before each line
